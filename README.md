# Hello-world
A repository in order to learn to start to use github

It seems like i need to write a little about myself so here it goes : I'm Julien, 22 and i'm starting to leanr how to code, i already know the basics of HTML5, CSS3 and some Javascipt aswell as PHP & MySQL. Even tho, i'm still a beginner or a Novice, idk which one is the best to describe my skill level.

Anyway, i think i talked about the most important and relevant thing here so thank you for readign and have a good day.
